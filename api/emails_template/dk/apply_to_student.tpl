Next Steps

1) A SHORT MOTIVATIONAL LETTER. (max. 300 words) in English in which you describe:Why do you want to learn programming and particularly web-development?What would you like to build if you were a really good programmer?

The deadline for sending this mail is SEPTEMBER 24TH at 23:59 latest.

Once you have sent your CV and motivational letter we will register your application. Then we will send you a test assignment around SEPTEMBER 26TH (Don't worry, it requires no previous knowledge of programming).

Requirements

We want to have as many people as possible enrolling in our program. However, in order to be able to offer you a high quality course we have certain requirements for our students. The most important one is that you need to speak ENGLISH at a good level. Learning how to program isn't easy, but learning it in a language that you don't understand well will make it almost impossible to keep up with our course.

In order to learn programming, it's really important that you have the time and the motivation to learn. We require our students to study around 30 HOURS PER WEEK, which is quite demanding.

Furthermore, everybody who learns how to code will face a lot of problems when learning and it will be frustrating at some times. It's important to be determined about wanting to learn to code in order to succeed in the program. Ask yourself: Do I know what it means to be a programmer?

 
Preparation

If you want, you can get a head-start by trying some tutorials about some of the things we teach (HTML5, CSS3, Responsive design and basic JavaScript).

Don't know where to find them? Ask us about useful resources in your email and we can send you some free online resources to prepare yourself for the classes.
