Dear Applicant,

Unfortunately the upload of your CV/Motivation letter did not succeed. Try uploading it again, but this time in a different file format: .doc, .docx, .pdf.

If you want to resubmit your motivation and CV, you can use the same link in the previous email, titled "Thank you for applying". 

Kind regards,

The HackYourFuture Team
