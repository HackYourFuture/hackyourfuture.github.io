Dear Applicants,

Thank you for applying to our program. We’re glad to see so many of you who want to educate themselves in the field of web-development.

We only select those who show potential to learn and really want to make something out of themselves. As such, the selection process is quite tough.

In order for you to get on the program, you’ll need to fulfil certain requirements:

- Your English needs to be good, or conversational at minimum. This is because all communication in HackYourFuture will be in English.
- You have the time and the motivation to learn. We require our students to study around 30 hours per week, which is demanding.
- You are not afraid to fail. During the program you will feel frustrated. It’s important to keep going after every setback.

If you think you pass the requirements we’d like to ask you to send us the following:
- A short essay that describes your motivation.
- Your Curriculum Vitae (CV).

The short essay (max. 300 words) should be written in correct English. The content should be about the following questions:

1. Why do you want to learn programming and particularly web-development?

2. What would you like to build if you were are really good programmer?
(doesn’t have to be related to web-development, can be anything related to programming)

You can now apply for the class that starts near the end of April. The deadline is the 3rd of April, at 23.59 .
