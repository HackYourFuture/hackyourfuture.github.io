Dear Applicant,

Thank you for applying to our program. 

We receive over 100+ applications for every class. Therefore, our selection process is tough.

What are the minimum requirements to participate in the program?

- Your English needs to be good, or conversational at least. This is because all communication in HackYourFuture will be in English.
- You have the time and the motivation to learn. We require our students to study at least 30 hours per week, which is demanding.
- You are not afraid to fail. During the program you will feel frustrated. Itâ€™s important to keep going after every setback.

If you think you pass the requirements we'd like to ask you to do a technical assignment. You will get details on what to do after the application deadline has passed.

The deadline for application is June 9th, 23.59. Expect an email from us shortly after that date!

Kind regards,

The HackYourFuture Team
