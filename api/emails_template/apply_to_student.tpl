Dear Applicant,

Thank you for applying to our program. 

We receive over 100+ applications for every class. Therefore, our selection process is tough.

What are the minimum requirements to participate in the program?

- Your English needs to be good, or conversational at least. This is because all communication in HackYourFuture will be in English.
- You have the time and the motivation to learn. We require our students to study at least 30 hours per week, which is demanding.
- You are not afraid to fail. During the program you will feel frustrated. Itâ€™s important to keep going after every setback.

The deadline for applying is the 10th of April, at 23.59.

Kind regards,

The HackYourFuture Team
