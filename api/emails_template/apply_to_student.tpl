Dear Applicant,

Thank you for applying to our program.

We receive over 100+ applications for every class. Therefore, our selection process is tough.

What are the minimum requirements to participate in the program?

- Your English needs to be good, or conversational at least. All communication in HackYourFuture will be in English.
- You have the time and the motivation to learn. We require our students to study at least 30 hours per week, which is demanding.
- You are not afraid to fail. During the program you will feel frustrated. It’s important to keep going after every setback.
- You are committed to study with HYF for 7 months. We expect you to finish the course. We will help you find a job as a programmer afterwards. However, dropping out during the course because of a job or internship opportunity is not allowed.

You will get details on what to do after the application deadline has passed. We will grade your CV and Motivation letter. If we grade them well, you will receive instructions to make a technical assignment.

The deadline for application is October 6th, 23.59. Expect an email from us shortly after that date!

Kind regards,

The HackYourFuture Team
