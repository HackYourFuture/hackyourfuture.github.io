Dear Applicant,

Thank you for applying to our program. 

We receive over 100+ applications for every class. Therefore, our selection process is tough.

What are the minimum requirements to participate in the program?

- Your English needs to be good, or conversational at least. This is because all communication in HackYourFuture will be in English.
- You have the time and the motivation to learn. We require our students to study at least 30 hours per week, which is demanding.
- You are not afraid to fail. During the program you will feel frustrated. It’s important to keep going after every setback.

If you think you pass the requirements we’d like to ask you to send us the following:
- A motivation letter that describes your reasons for applying.
- Your Curriculum Vitae (CV).

The motivation letter (max. 300 words) should be written in correct English. The content should be about the following questions:

1. Why do you want to learn programming and particularly web-development?

2. What is your single biggest strength and single biggest weakness? 

The deadline for handing in your CV and motivation letter is the 3rd of April, at 23.59.

Use the following link to send us your motivation letter and CV:

The HackYourFuture Team
