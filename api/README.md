## Cloud Services and deploys

We currently use `terraform.io` to access to `aws` resources, we wanna maintain
our cloud environment under control and we choose to host the
[infrastructure](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/infrastucture) in code.

### Currently aws used resources.

- Simple Email Service
- Lambda
- API Gateway
- Cloud Watch log
