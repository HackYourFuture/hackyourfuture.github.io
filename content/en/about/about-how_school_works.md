# How our school works

Our coding school teaches a 6-month full-stack web development program. The curriculum is created and taught by our volunteer network of over forty professional developers.

Our students learn the fundamentals of full-stack web-development, with a focus on modern JavaScript. Our students aren’t just taught the mechanics of coding; they learn how to work on projects in a modern tech team, how to be problem-solvers. They learn to think like developers.

HackYourFuture teaches every Sunday. We pay for students’ travel, so our students can join us from all over the country. In addition to our in-person teaching sessions, we coach and support our students online throughout the week.
