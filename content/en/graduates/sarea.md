# Sarea Al Kebaky  
Sarea is our very first student. He studied computer science in Damascus, before the Syrian war broke out. When Sarea started at HackYourFuture he felt he forgot everything he learned in university. During our course he learned to work with the latest programming languages. While living in his refugee-camp, he built Amsterdam Voorziet, an online platform for underprivileged citizens in need of support and services.   

After his course, HackYourFuture helped Sarea to find an internship. He was then hired by ZIVVER as a frontend developer. Because of his stable income Sarea’s wife was able to move to the Netherlands. She is currently a student at HackYourFuture as well.
