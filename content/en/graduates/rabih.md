# Rabih Alqaraweet
Before Rabih came to the Netherlands, he studied software engineering in Syria. Yet the frameworks and programming languages taught by HackYourFuture were new to him. The course was a challenge as he was doing his mandatory Dutch classes at the same time. Rabih: “Sometimes I made weeks of 60-70 hours.”   

After the course HackYourFuture helped Rabih to start an internship at the software company Owlin. He exceeded expectations and was offered a job. According to Sjoerd Leemhuis, co-founder of Owlin, hiring Rabih was not an act of pure altruism, but also “a very rational business decision. He simply adds a lot of value, that’s why we want him to be part of the team.”
