# What we teach

Our students learn to build full-stack applications. We teach HTML, CSS, Command Line, Git, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, MySQL and MongoDB.

Aside from technology, our students learn how to think like a programmer by solving problems and work in teams. These fundamental skills prepare our students for their first jobs as web developers.

Our curriculum is an open-source project. It is continuously updated and adapted to the latest cutting-edge technologies. Anybody - teachers, students, or a random contributor - can open an issue or pull request to suggest improvements.
