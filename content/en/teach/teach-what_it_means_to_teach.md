# What it means to be a teacher

Most of our teachers commit to teaching in-person for four hours each Sunday. Our curriculum is organised into modules (topics) of three weeks each, so teachers are typically assigned to teach in three-week periods together with another volunteer, as well as providing feedback on studentsâ€™ homework for their module. Every module consists of readings, videos and practical assignments. During the week students can ask questions in Slack and through online Q&A sessions, with over 40 skilled developers on stand-by.
