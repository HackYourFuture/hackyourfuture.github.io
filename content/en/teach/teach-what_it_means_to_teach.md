# What it means to be a teacher

Most of our teachers commit to teaching in-person for four hours each Sunday. Our curriculum is organised into modules (topics) of three weeks each. Teachers are typically assigned to teach a module in pairs, as well as providing feedback on studentsâ€™ homework. During the week students receive online support, with over 40 skilled developers on stand-by.
