# Who are our teachers

All our teachers are skilled developers, with multiple years of experience. They teach in their free time on weekends and in evenings. Our teachers work for a range of companies, from start-ups to major corporations.

We like to refer to our volunteers as 'mentorsâ€™, as they provide support, guidance, and advice to our students in addition to technical expertise.
