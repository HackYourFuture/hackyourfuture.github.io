# Hire Alumni

Are you looking for junior web developers while making a positive impact on society? We can help.

Most of our students are fresh graduates, looking to start their career as a developer. They are talented, as they are selected out of a pool of more than 100 applicants. Our students have residency permits for at least 5 years. This enables them to work in the Netherlands just like any other citizen.
