# HackYourFuture trains the next generation of full-stack software developers.

Our coding school teaches a 7-month web development program to refugees, asylum seekers and other groups with limited access to education and the labour market. Our goal is not only to educate our students, but also to guide them towards employment and integrate them into the developer community.

Training our students in computer programming significantly boosts their chances of fulfilling, long-term employment. Plus, it fills a gap on the job market. Everyone wins.

Our approach works: Over 85% of our graduates have gone on to find jobs in the tech industry.
