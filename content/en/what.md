# HackYourFuture trains refugees to become full-stack software developers. 

In our 4 schools throughout Europe, we teach software development to refugees in our six month program. Our curriculum is created and taught by our large volunteer network that consist of professional developers. They teach our students how to work on projects in a modern tech team. How to be problem-solvers. At HackYourFuture, students learn to think like developers. 

Training refugees in computer programming significantly boosts their chances of fulfilling, long-term employment. Plus, it fills a gap on the job market. Everybody wins.

Our approach works: 96% of our graduates have gone on to find jobs in the tech industry.
